# PythonLearning

Welcome to Python Learning using an approach of '**Code with Purpose**'. 

**Code with Purpose** starts with a requirement (business need), and then a corresponding python code is written to automate the functionality for that requirement.

To achieve this, I have created a fictional company called **Alpha Motors**. Each assignment is tied with the requirement related to Alpha Motors. 

The assignments are broken in three levels:
- Beginner 
- Intermediate 
- Advanced

**Happy Learning!**
